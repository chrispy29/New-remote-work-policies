•	How to reduce or eliminate communication issues: 
Rule 1: Perform a complete search of the company databases to find if the entry of file you are looking for already exists. Do not start a new one until the search has been completed and no other entries have been found. 
Rule 2: Any existing files that do get used must be dated within the last 1-2 years. If it falls outside of that timeframe, the content must be reviewed to ensure it is still up to date and correct. Any irrelevant information must be updated, and any mistakes must be corrected. 
Rule 3: All documentation must be formatted as per the company guidelines, remaining uniform throughout. All documentation must also be checked for any grammatical errors before submission, and must contain adequate visual information (e.g., screenshots). 
•	How to ensure everyone receives information: 
Rule 1: All changes to entries and files within the company database, as well as new entries created and added, must be communicated to all relevant staff. This must be done via email, with a copy of the updated or new entry attached and must contain a prompt from the sender for the recipient to confirm they have received the new information, read it and understood it. All staff that receive such an email must read the updated entry and either confirm they have read and understood it or reply with any queries about the information within 24-48 hours of the email being sent. After this time the information will be added to the database and be put into effect. 
Rule 2: Ensure emails are checked at least every 1-2 hours in case of any emergency emails or any updated information being sent through. In the case of any emergency emails ensure all responses are within 1-2 hours if they require one. 

•	How to protect the data and user when working remotely from a home or public network: 
Rule 1: When using company systems in a remote setting, ensure all computer screens are kept out of the view of the public. 
Rule 2: Keep you workstation clear of any sensitive or confidential information such as passwords, company documents or client information. 
•	How to share data/files using OneDrive to allow files to be viewed but not edited or downloaded: 
When sharing data through OneDrive, ensure that “Allow editing” is deselected so that the recipient may only view the document without making any changes. 
•	How to handle or share confidential data 
Rule 1: Keep all confidential data stored on, or distributed through, company approved storage methods and sharing tools. 
Rule 2: Keep all physical copies of confidential data secured and away from public viewing, or if the physical copy is no longer necessary, have the document sent to the main offices for destruction.
